### Working with `/docs` content

#### URL paths

All `.md` files added to `./content/md/en/docs/` folder will output an URL path without the `/docs` prefix, eg.:

- `index.md` for a category page : `./content/md/en/docs/reference/index.md` &rarr; `/reference/`
- `<article-name>.md` for an article in its parent category `./content/md/en/docs/reference/glossary.md` &rarr; `/reference/glossary/`

You can use any structure nesting needed, there is no limit of depth.

#### Media / Images

- use `./content/media/images/docs/` folder for images to be included in `/docs/*/*.md` files
- source images in `.md`: `/media/images/docs/path/to/your/image/<image>.ext`

#### Navigation config

- Use file `./content/config/nav.yaml` to add items and linking to your content

This config file is used to generate sidebar menu where:

- menu is populated from the `menu` sequence (respecting order)
- menu supports three level hierarchy
- menu accepts external links, eg.: `https://substrate.io`
